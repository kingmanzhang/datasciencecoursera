Here we plot mtcars dataset with Plotly. 
```{r message=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~as.factor(gear), y = ~mpg, color = ~as.factor(gear), type = "box") %>% layout(title = "Fuel efficiency changes with the number of gears", xaxis = list(title = "gear number"), showlegend = FALSE)
```
