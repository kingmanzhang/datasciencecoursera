Column 1 and 2 are subject id and activity performed. Column 3 to 81 are the average of each feature in the origin feature matrix. The features come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. The features were preprocessed and the mean and standard deviation were calculated for the x, y, z axial. Refer to the features_info.txt for details.
